TexturePackerLoader
===================

Using a sprite sheet (or texture atlas) increases your game's performance
while also reducing the amount of memory.

This library includes a loader and sprite renderer to load animations and sprites
from a sprite sheet created with TexturePacker.
Its source code can be found on https://github.com/CodeAndWeb/TexturePacker-MonoGameLoader

A tutorial with full source code about how to create sprite sheets is available from
https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-and-animations-with-monogame

The tutorial contains additional modules like an animation manager for
simple playback of animated sprites.
